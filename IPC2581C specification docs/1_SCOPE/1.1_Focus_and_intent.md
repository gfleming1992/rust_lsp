# 1.1 Focus and intent

The generic format requirements are outlined in a series of standards for printed board manufacturing, assembly, and inspection testing. The series includes a generic standard (IPC-2581) covering general requirements, and seven sectional standards (IPC-2582 through IPC-2588) that detail XML requirements for accumulating information in a single file. These sectional standards paraphrase key requirements and provide recommended usage and examples relevant to specific manufacturing disciplines.
