# 1.0 SCOPE

This standard defines the XML schema for an intelligent data file format used to describe printed board and printed board assembly products. It provides sufficient detail for tooling, manufacturing, assembly, and inspection processes. The format facilitates information exchange between printed board designers and manufacturing or assembly facilities, especially when computer-aided processes and numerical control machines are involved. Data can be specified in either English or International System of Units (SI).
