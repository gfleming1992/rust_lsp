# 9.2.1 AvlVmpn

The AvlVmpn element represents the approved vendor part number substitution that might be implemented as an alternate to the OEMDesignNumber supplied by the user. The details of the information may be extracted from an external vendor part library, and if this technique is used the attributes of “qualified” and “chosen” must be included in the file.
