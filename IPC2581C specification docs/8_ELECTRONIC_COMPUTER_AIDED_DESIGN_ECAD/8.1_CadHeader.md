# 8.1 CadHeader

The `CadHeader` element is mandatory. It contains general attributes describing the printed board, assembly, tooling, and documentation as defined in `CadData`. The `Spec` element defines special instructions, tolerances, and locations where they apply. Unit definitions apply to all ECAD data, though a `Spec` may define different units for its own properties without affecting the global ECAD units. Any dictionary-referenced features shall use the same units as the ECAD `units` setting.
