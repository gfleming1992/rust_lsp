# 8.2.2.1.1 StackupLayer

The StackupLayer represents all the layers of the printed board. Individual layers may be identified as material layers and are used to help define the layer pairs designated in StackupGroup.

| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|
| layerOrGroupRef         | qualifiedNameType       | A reference to an individual layer or a group that has been previously identified. A single sheet of copper foil may be a named layer and would thus apply to the group, as would a layer pair of copper clad laminate purchased from a laminator. | 1-1 |
| thickness               | nonNegativeDoubleType   | The thickness of the particular material being defined. The thickness matches nominal thickness of a predefined StackupGroup. | 1-1 |
| tolPlus                 | nonNegativeDoubleType   | The plus tolerance that may be applied to the nominal thickness to set the layer upper control limit. If this is a StackupGroup the tolerances shall match those indicated in the group description. | 1-1 |
| tolMinus                | nonNegativeDoubleType   | The minus tolerance that may be applied to the nominal thickness to set the layer lower control limit. If this is a StackupGroup the tolerances shall match those indicated in the group description. | 1-1 |
| tolPercent              | boolean                 | An enumerated string is either “true” or “false” (part of the 3WC standard – must be lower case). True means that the attribute(s) tolPlus and tolMinus are a percentage. False indicates that they represent a nonNegativeDouble. The Default is “false”. | 0-1 |
| sequence                | nonNegativeDoubleType   | The specific order in which the layer materials or layer pairs are positioned in the stackup stating with the top of the board as sequence 1 followed by the entire board construction of imaged or un-imaged layers/layer pairs. | 0-1 |
| matDes                  | qualifiedNameType       | A unique reference designator using the letters in Appendix C followed by a number in order to represent the StackupLayer that could be called for in a Bill of Material for the printed board construction. | 0-1 |
| comment                 | string                  | An optional attribute used to provide any special instructions about the layering or stackup of a multilayer single-sided, or double-sided printed board. | 0-1 |
| SpecRef                 | SpecRefType             | The identification of a particular specification(s) from the SpecificationType that is able to provide additional details or instructions that apply to the board or assembly descriptions of the Stackup Layer. The linkage is provided through the specific “specificationId” (spec Name). | 0-1 |
