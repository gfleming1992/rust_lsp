# 8.2.2.1 StackupGroup

The `StackupGroup` represents all the layers of the printed board and defines the order of their occurrence in the board construction. Individual layers may be identified as layer pairs, allowing users to define multilayer construction and prepare layer prelamination sequences. The order must match the description of the final board. If `StackupGroup` represents the finished board, its attributes apply to the entire finished board; if it identifies layer pairs, attributes apply only to those pairs, which are called for in the stackup by their qualified name in order.

## Attribute Table

| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|
| StackupGroup            | StackupGroupType        | A nested element containing information about printed board construction. | 0-n |
| name                    | qualifiedNameType       | Unique name for an individual or group of layers in the board. Must be unique for proper referencing in the stackup. | 1-1 |
| thickness               | nonNegativeDoubleType   | Nominal thickness of the stackup group. If representing the total board, must match Stackup thickness. | 1-1 |
| tolPlus                 | nonNegativeDoubleType   | Plus tolerance for nominal thickness (upper control limit). | 1-1 |
| tolMinus                | nonNegativeDoubleType   | Minus tolerance for nominal thickness (lower control limit). | 1-1 |
| tolPercent              | boolean                 | True if tolPlus/tolMinus are percentages, false if nonNegativeDouble. Default is false. | 0-1 |
| matDes                  | qualifiedNameType       | Reference designator for the StackupGroup as an orderable item in the Bill of Material. | 0-1 |
| comment                 | string                  | Special instructions about layering, layer pairs, or StackupGroup. | 0-1 |
| StackupLayer            | StackupLayerType        | Contains all layer formation for board construction. Layer pairs produced separately may be defined as a group and positioned in order. | 0-n |
| CADDataLayerRef         | LayerType               | Layer names assigned by the CAD system, representing a link to layers in the StackupGroup. | 0-n |
| SpecRef                 | SpecRefType             | Reference to specifications providing additional details or instructions. | 0-n |

## Example of Property References for a Stackup Spec

The example below shows:
- A given Spec definition can contain multiple Specification Types.
- When a Specification Type for a StackupLayer Spec contains multiple values at different refValues (e.g., for simulation purposes), a refValue can be assigned within a Spec referenced at the Stackup level to indicate a reference value for board fabrication.

```xml
<Spec name="property_references">
    <Dielectric type="DIELECTRIC_CONSTANT">
        <Property refValue="10.0e9" refUnit="Hz"/>
    </Dielectric>
    <Dielectric type="LOSS_TANGENT">
        <Property refValue="10.0e9" refUnit="Hz"/>
    </Dielectric>
    <Conductor type="CONDUCTIVITY">
        <Property refValue="25" refUnit="CELCIUS"/>
    </Conductor>
    <Impedance value="50" plusTol="10" minusTol="10" tolPercent="true">
        <SingleEnded structure="MICROSTRIP_MASK_COVERED">
            <LineWidth value="0.3" unit="MM"/>
        </SingleEnded>
    </Impedance>
</Spec>
