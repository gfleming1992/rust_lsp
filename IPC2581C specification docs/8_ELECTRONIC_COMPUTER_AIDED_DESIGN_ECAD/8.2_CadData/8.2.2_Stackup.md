# 8.2.2 Stackup

The `Stackup` element represents the construction for the printed board. The Stackup element consists of several sub-elements that help to define various sections of the construction, permitting the description of core material or prepreg definition. These are accomplished in the `StackupGroup` element. The attributes of the Stackup element represent the finished board and apply to the entire board characteristics. The reference in the Bill of Material is to the finished board and as such uses the `matDes` identification as the `BomDesType`.

## Attribute Table

| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Stackup                 | StackupType             | A nested element containing the construction information for the printed board. | 0-1 |
| name                    | qualifiedNameType       | A unique name assigned by the user to the printed board. The name must be unique and match the name used for the layerFunction STACKUP_COMPOSITE assigned by the CadData element. | 1-1 |
| overallThickness        | nonNegativeDoubleType   | Describes the overall nominal thickness of the finished printed board including all plating and coatings. | 1-1 |
| tolPlus                 | nonNegativeDoubleType   | The plus tolerance that may be applied to the nominal thickness to set the printed board upper control limit. | 1-1 |
| tolMinus                | nonNegativeDoubleType   | The minus tolerance that may be applied to the nominal thickness to set the printed board lower control limit. | 1-1 |
| tolPercent              | boolean                 | An enumerated string, either “true” or “false” (must be lower case). True means that tolPlus and tolMinus are a percentage. False indicates that they represent a nonNegativeDouble. Default is “false”. | 0-1 |
| whereMeasured           | whereMeasuredType       | An enumerated string: LAMINATE, METAL, MASK, OTHER, that defines the location on the printed board, panel, or assembly where the overall thickness is measured. | 1-1 |
| matDes                  | qualifiedNameType       | A unique reference designator, using the letters in Appendix C followed by a number, representing the composite stackup that could be called for in a Bill of Material for the printed board construction. | 0-1 |
| comment                 | string                  | Optional attribute for special instructions about layering, specification requirements, or stackup of an HDI, multilayer, single-sided, or double-sided printed board. | 0-1 |
| stackupStatus           | stackupStatusType       | Enumerated string: SPECIFIED, PROPOSED, APPROVED. SPECIFIED indicates a request from the OEM, PROPOSED a response from a fabricator, and APPROVED indicates OEM approval. | 1-1 |
| SpecRef                 | SpecRefType             | Identification of specification(s) from SpecificationType providing additional details or instructions for the board or assembly descriptions of the Stackup. Linked via specificationId (spec Name). | 0-n |
| StackupGroup            | StackupGroupType        | A nested element containing information about printed board construction. StackupGroup elements should be defined within the Stackup before being referenced in the IPC-2581 file. | 0-n |
