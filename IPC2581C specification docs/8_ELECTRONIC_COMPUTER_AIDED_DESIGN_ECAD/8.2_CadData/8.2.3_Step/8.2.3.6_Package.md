# 8.2.3.6 Package

The Package element descriptions define the package shape (Outline), library descriptions including land patterns, silk screen information, assembly drawing details, and pin identification. The Package element defines all the physical description of all the packages used by the Component element inside the Step. The names assigned to the package should be consistent with the naming convention established in IPC-7351  for parts and land pattern descriptions. (Refer to Section 2 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS)

Note: You may encounter a footprint similar to that shown on the left, which has only one signal pin in the center and the surrounding pins are ground pins. You could say that pinOne is the center pin, and assign a pinOneOrientation value of “OTHER” for this, with a comment value of “CENTER”. However there is then no point of reference for a rotation, and the case could have protusions or markings that make it non symmetrical. It is therefore preferential to assign pinOne to one of the outer pins, and set the pinOneOrientation from there accordingly.

## 8.2.3.6.1 LandPattern
The LandPattern element consists of those characteristics that define the pattern to which surface mount components are attached. The embedded elements include both the Pad description and the potential for providing a target, usually indicating pinOne. Land pattern descriptions should be used wherever a relationship to component pins needs to be established. This information is redundant when layers for component attachment are defined.
