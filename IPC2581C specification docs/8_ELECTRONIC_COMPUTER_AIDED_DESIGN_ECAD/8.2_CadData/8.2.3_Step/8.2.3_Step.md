# 8.2.3 Step

0-n

The Step element represents a collection of layers, each with a profile that defines its outer shape. The basic step is the Printed Circuit Assembly (PCA), the unpopulated board or other related information (e.g., documentation). In manufacturing, this basic step is often step and repeated (nested) inside a larger step (called array, or sub-panel). This array step can be further nested into another step; called a production panel. The Ecad element always contains at least one Step, but may contain several, some basic ones and others nesting previous steps.

The CAD Step tag can be repeated multiple times inside a job to represent several job Steps and their optional panelization. Each Step contains all the relevant information including Datum, Profile, StepRepeat, LayerAttribute, Package, Component, VplComponent, LogicalNet and LayerFeature.

All steps inside an Ecad element share the exact same layer structure, since they are ‘cut’ from the same basic panel. Each layer, in the list of layers, exists in every step, although in each step it may contain different graphical information or be empty.

## Attributes

| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Step | StepType | The Step element consists of multiple sub-elements each intended to help describe the different steps needed in the board fabrication, or assembling the electronic product. | 1-n |
| name | string | The name assigned by the user for the individual Steps used to make up the layers identified in a particular StepList. | 1-1 |
| type | stepType | An optional enumerated string to identify what the Step represents. Choices are BOARD | ARRAY | IC | 0-1 |
| stackupRef | qualifiedNameType | An optional reference to an associated stackup, if there is another step with a different stackup (that is not a stackup zone) | 0-1 |
| NonstandardAttribute | Nonstandard AttributeType | A nested element that can be used to provide extra details regarding a particular “Step” description in terms of BOOLEAN, DOUBLE,  INTEGER, or STRING data. The properties of the NonstandardAttribute become unique due to its’ Name.  | 0-n |
| PadStackDef | PadStackDefType | An element that describes the construction of various padstack types used in the design of the printed board, and provides a correlation to the usage of the padstack to those holes or pads that help to form the padstack.  | 0-n |
| Datum | LocationType | The Datum element defines the location of the point of origin for the individual Step file. The name of the StepList helps to associate the datum between boards and panels or arrays. | 1-1 |
| Profile | ContourType | The profile of all the elements in the Step established as a Contour. | 0-1 |
| StepRepeat | StepRepeatType | A nested element specifying the quantity and location of  a “single piece” board Step, if this is the Step of a panel or assembly pallet. | 0-n |
| Package | PackageType | Generic component package descriptions for use by the Step file schemas. | 0-n |
| Component | ComponentType | A nested element list of component descriptions and their application to the electronic product. Each component references a package style from the Package section. | 0-n |
| LogicalNet | LogicalNetType | A nested element list of logical net descriptions and their application to the electronic product. | 0-n |
| PhyNetGroup | PhyNetGroupType | A nested element list of physical net descriptions and their application to the electronic product. | 0-n |
| LayerFeature | LayerFeatureType | A nested element list of all the features associated with a specific layer and their application to the electronic product. | 0-n |
| BendArea | BendAreaType | A nested element describing a bend in a flex section of a design | 0-1 |
| StackupZone | StackupZoneType | A nested element defining stackup zones in a rigid flex design | 0-1 |
| Port | PortType | A nested element defining a port in the Step, and its connection to other Step(s) or component(s) | 0-1 |
| Model | ModelType | A nested element defining a simple 3D model that can be used to describe coins, components, and other objects attached to the PCB | 0-1 |
| DfxMeasurementList | DfxMeasurement ListType | A nested element list of the recommended modifications of the design features, indicating the measurements made of the physical conditions that might be considered as manufacturing improvements. | 0-n |
