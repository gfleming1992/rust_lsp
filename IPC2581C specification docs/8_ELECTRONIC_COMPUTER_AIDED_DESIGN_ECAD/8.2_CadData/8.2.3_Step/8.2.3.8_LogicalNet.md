# 8.2.3.8 LogicalNet

The LogicalNet section is a list of LogicalNet elements, each with a name and a group of component/pin 
location(s). It enables the labeling of each pin with the net to which it belongs. The PhyNetGroupList is another 
representation of a netlist, using physical board locations instead of logical pins.  
LogicalNet elements read from the CAD system in the form of component pins connectivity. Each LogicalNet 
contains the net name and a set of LogicalNetPin. Each LogicalNetPin points to a pin on a component. 
  

## Attributes

| Attribute /  Element Name | Attribute /  Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|---|---|---|---|
| LogicalNet | LogicalNetType | The LogicalNet element consists of the characteristics that are all electrically common. These can include conductor, vias, or planes. | 0-n |
| name | qualifiedNameType | The unique name assigned to the electrical description of the net. | 1-1 |
| netClass | netClassType | An enumerated string identifying one of the following net class types CLK | FIXED | GROUND | SIGNAL | POWER | UNUSED | 0-1 |
| netPair | qualifiedNameType | The unique name assigned to the net that forms a differential pair with the net name | 0-1 |
| NonstandardAttribute | NonstandardAttribute Type | A nested element that can be used to provide extra details regarding a particular “LogicalNet” description in terms of BOOLEAN, DOUBLE, INTEGER, or STRING data. The properties of the NonstandardAttribute become unique due to its’ Name.  | 0-n |
| PinRef | PinRefType | An individual Pin related to the place where a component attaches to the net. This description facilitates location of lands on the surface of the board or places where through-hole components are mounted. | 1-n |
| PortRef | PortRefType | An optional reference to a unique ID of a port that interfaces to another Step with the file. The other Step would represent another design entity, such as a daughter card or custom IC. | 0-n |
| SpecRef | SpecRefType | A unique reference to a specification pertaining to the LogicalNet | 0-n |
