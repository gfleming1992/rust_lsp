##### 8.2.3.15.2.1.1 FeatureDescription

The FeatureDescription element is used to define the geometry and location that represents the object being 
referenced. The location is associated to a specific layer where the object exists. 

| Attribute /  Element Name | Attribute /  Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|---|---|---|---|
| FeatureDescription | FeatureDescriptionType | A nested element that can be 1 or 2 feature descriptions related to the definitions used in the Simple graphic descriptions. The second FeatureDescription may be either a solution or a second feature that is in conflict with the first feature. | 0-n |
| layerRef | qualifiedNameType | A reference to the specific layer in the Ecad layer section that pertains to the specifics of the DfxMeasurement | 0-1 |
| pinRef | qualifiedNameType | An individual Pin related to the place where a component attaches to the net. This description facilitates location of lands on the surface of the board or places where through-hole components are mounted. | 0-1 |
| componentRef | qualifiedNameType | Identifies the reference designator used as the attribute refDes of the Component element in Step. It is the reference to the component that is connected by the particular Pin and becomes a part of the electrical description of the net. The componentRef attribute is not required when used for a PinRef element under Pad elements which are under LandPattern elements. Otherwise, the componentRef attribute is required for PinRef elements under Pad, LayerPad and LogicalNet elements.  | 0-1 |
| packageRef | qualifiedNameType | The name assigned to the package describing the physical outlines, documentation, and land patterns features related to package pin assignment. | 0-1 |
| specRef | qualifiedNameType | The identification of a particular specification(s) from the SpecificationType that is able to provide additional details or instructions that apply to the board or assembly descriptions of the Layer. The linkage is provided through the specific “specificationId” (spec Name) | 0-1 |
| firmwareRef | qualifiedNameType | The specific reference to firmware previously defined and contained in the DictionaryFirmware. | 0-1 |
| padstackDefRef | qualifiedNameType | A reference to the name of the padstackDef element that provides the characteristics of individual padstacks in the design, as established by the CAD system, and provides the link to the layer distribution of the padstack’s individual characteristics. | 0-1 |
| netRef | qualifiedNameType | A reference to a logical net whose reference value is a logicalNet name. | 0-1 |
| stackupRef | qualifiedNameType | A reference to the stackup where the feature resides, if there are multiple stackupds in the file. | 0-1 |
| bomRef | qualifiedNameType | A reference to a specific Bom element. Required if there is more than one BOM in the file | 0-1 |
| featureObject | featureObjectType | A brief description of the type of object referenced as an enumerated attribute whose values are:  PAD | SHAPE | POLYGON | COMPONENT| DRILL/HOLE | CUTOUT | OUTLINE | TEXT | SLOT | CAVITY | ZONE | BEND | PORT | MILLING | OTHER (requires comment)  | 0-1 |
| comment | string | To describe a featureObject type of OTHER, and/or any other information about the object. | 0-1 |
| Feature | ABSTRACT | An embedded element that defines a feature (StandardShape or UserShape) that may be used to describe the shape of the Dfx object.  | 0-1 |
| Xform | XformType | An optional element that provides the ability to offset the origin, scale, mirror, or rotate the Feature.  | 0-1 |
| Location | LocationType | The location of an object referenced in the design, such as pinRef or componentRef, or the location of a shape defiend by Feature. If Feature has its own built-in co-ordinates, such as Line or Polyline, then Location is not required. | 0-1 |
