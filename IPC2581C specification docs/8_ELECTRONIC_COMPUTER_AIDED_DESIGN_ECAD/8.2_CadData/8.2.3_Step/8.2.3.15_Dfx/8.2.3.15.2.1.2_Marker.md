##### 8.2.3.15.2.1.2 Marker

The Marker element is used to define the location of a single point, multiple points or boundary that may be displayed 
graphically to represent the location of a point or area of interest. The marker is a geometry as defined in the 
StandardPrimitive substitution group. The geometry is repeated at each specified location. These locations are 
associated to a specific layer where the points of interest are positioned in the design data. 
 
| Attribute /  Element Name | Attribute /  Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Marker | MarkerType  | A substitution group of any StandardPrimitive used to display a graphical shape, to flag or enclose the point(s) of interest. | 0-1 |
| LayerRef | LayerRefType  | The specific layer containing the object(s) that the marker(s) refer to | 1-1 |
| StandardPrimitive | ABSTRACT | A substitution group that permits the substitution of the StandardPrimitive element with any of the sixteen standard primitive types. | 1-1 |
| Xform | XformType | An optional element that provides the ability to offset the origin, scale, mirror, or rotate the StandardPrimitive. | 0-1 |
| Location | LocationType | The X:Y position defined in the same units as defined in the dataset, which is the point of origin for each marker geometry | 1-n |
