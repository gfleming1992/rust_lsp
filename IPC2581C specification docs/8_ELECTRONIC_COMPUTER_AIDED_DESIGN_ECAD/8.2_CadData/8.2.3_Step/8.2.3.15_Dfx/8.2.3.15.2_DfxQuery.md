## 8.2.3.15.2 DfxQuery

The DfxQuery element is used to communicate DFx issues that may not necessarily have a specific location or 
criteria or DFx issues that need more descriptive clarification than what can be indicated with the Criteria alone.  
This element also allows for a receiver of the DFx information to respond to the DFx items.
