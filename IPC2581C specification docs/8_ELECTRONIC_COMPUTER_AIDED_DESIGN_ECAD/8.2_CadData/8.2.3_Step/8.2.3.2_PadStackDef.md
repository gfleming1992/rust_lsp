# 8.2.3.2 PadStackDef

The PadStackDef element consists of multiple padstacks types or descriptions taken from the CAD system and is intended to preserve the data from the layout system. The information noted pertain to the CadProperty of which the padstack is a part. The relationship is identified by the CadProperty unique name and is the original design file from the CAD system. The data becomes although redundant when the individual layered features are defined provides a reference for the padstack usage.

## 8.2.3.2.1 PadstackHoleDef

The PadstackHoleDef element associated with a padstack identifies the diameter, tolerance and plating status of a particular padstack location.

| Attribute /  Element Name | Attribute /  Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PadstackHoleDef | PadstackHoleDefType | The hole description of the padstack including all its attributes. | 0-1 |
| name | qualifiedNameType | A unique identification of a particular padstack hole description. | 1-1 |
| diameter | nonNegativeDouble Type | The nominal diameter of the hole in the as-finished state. | 1-1 |
| platingStatus | platingStatusType | The type of hole defined as an enumerated string indicating PLATED | NONPLATED | VIA | VIA_CAPPED | 1-1 |
| plusTol | nonNegativeDouble Type | The plus tolerance that defines the variation permitted from the nominal hole-diameter. | 1-1 |

## 8.2.3.2.2 PadstackPadDef

The PadstackPadPDef element is a specific graphic feature that becomes part of the padstack with a description of shape (Feature) and a location in order to establish the linkage to pads on individual layers.

| Attribute /  Element Name | Attribute /  Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PadstackPadDef | PadstackPadDefType | An element that provides the definition of various pads that are used to make up a padstack within the CAD system and provides the ability to locate where these are used in the design of the board. | 0-n |
| layerRef | qualifiedNameType | The reference to a specific layer element by it’s “name” attribute. The layer referenced is where the pad image is located. | 1-1 |
| padUse | padUseType | An enumerated value of the pad type used on the particular layer, such as a power or signal or mask layer. The enumerations are REGULAR | ANTIPAD | THERMAL | OTHER. If OTHER is used a comment is required to explain the purpose of the pad.  | 1-1 |
| comment | string | An explanation as to the  condition of the Pad if OTHER is defined as the padUse. A comment may also be used if the pad is not connected to circuitry and has been removed by the manufacturer to improve clearance conditons. | 0-1 |
| Xform | XformType | An element that provides the ability to reset the point of origin of a predefined target that can be scaled, mirror imaged or rotated. (See 3.3) | 0-1 |
| Location | LocationType | The location of the image defined by the standard shape, user shape or a pre-defined standard shape of the pad. The image may have been reorientated by the Xform. | 1-1 |
| Feature | ABSTRACT | An embedded element that defines a substitution group of any StandardShape or UserShape that may be instantiated as a part of the Pad Description. A predefined StandardShape or UserShape may also be instantiated by its unique “id” when the feature is contained in the DictionaryStandard or User. When a reference is made to the dictionary predefined primitive the Units must match. | 1-1 |
