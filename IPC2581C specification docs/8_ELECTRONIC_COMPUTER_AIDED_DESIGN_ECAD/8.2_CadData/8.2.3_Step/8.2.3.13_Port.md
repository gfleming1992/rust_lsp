# 8.2.3.13 Port

An embedded element to describe a physical and electrical connection between a point within the board Step and a 
point outside the board Step. The destination point could be within another Step in the same file, which represents a 
daughter board or a custom IC, or it could be a pin/pad of an off-the-shelf component. The port represents one of three 
types of connection: a wire bond, a connector pin mating, or a custom component pin to pad direct connection when 
the custom component is descried in another Step in the same file. 
 
## Attributes

| Attribute /  Element Name | Attribute /  Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Port | PortType | An element that signifies that the PhyNetPoint is physically and electrically connected to another object, such as a component by wire bond, or a daughter card by connector | 0-n |
| name | qualifiedNameType | A unique name assigned to the Port | 1-1 |
| netType | netFunctionType | An enumerated list to specify the direction (or other function) of the electrical signal carried by the port, in relation to the Step that the port is in. Possible values are INPUT | OUTPUT | BIDIRECTIONAL | VOLTAGE_REF | UNSPECIFIED | NO_CONNECT | OTHER | 0-1 |
| PortType | ABSTRACT | A substitution group that is replaced by one of 3 elements to define the port type:  WireBond – the port represents a wire bond that connects from the board to the pin of a component, which is either custom (defined in its own Step) or off the shelf; ConnectorMate, - the port represents the mating of pins between the connector on the board and the connector on another board (Step); ComponentPad – the port represents the connection between the board and the component pad of a custom IC which is defined in its own Step | 1-1 |
| comment | string | Text that describes a netType of OTHER or  any other details about the port | 0-1 |

## 8.2.3.13.1 PortConnect

A nested  element that defines the end point of a physical connection that the port represents. 
 
| Attribute /  Element Name | Attribute /  Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PortConnect | PortConnectType | An element that signifies the end point of a physical connection that the port represents. There can be multiple end points for a single start point | 1-n |
| name | qualifiedNameType | A unique name assigned to the PortConnect | 1-1 |
| stepRef | qualifiedNameType | An optional reference if the port connects to another Step, representing another board or custom IC | 0-1 |
| compRef  | qualifiedNameType | Reference to any component that is instantiated on the Step being connected to | 0-1 |
| pinRef | qualifiedNameType | Reference to any component that is instantiated on the Step being connected to | 0-1 |
| Location | LocationType | X y coordinates of the end point of the port. If the end point is in another Step then the coordinates shall be relative to that Step. This location shall match the location of a pad in the PhyNet section that has a PortRef attribute with a value equal to the name of this Port | 0-1 |
 
## 8.2.3.13.2 WireBond

A nested element that defines a wire bond. 
 
### Attributes

| Attribute /  Element Name | Attribute /  Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|---|---|---|---|
| WireBond | WireBondType | The definition of a wire bond | 1-1 |
| layerRef | qualifiedNameType | A reference to the layer that the wire bond starts from  | 1-1 |
| compRef  | qualifiedNameType | Reference to a component that is instantiated in the current Step which relates to the port | 0-1 |
| pinRef | qualifiedNameType | Reference to any component pin that is instantiated in the current Step which relates to the port | 0-1 |
| WireHeight | LengthPropertyType | The height relative to the parent board (Step) which defines a region that the bonding wire is restricted to. The attribute constraintType of LengthPropertyType can be set to indicate a MAX or MIN value | 0-1 |
| Location | LocationType | X y coordinates of the start point of the port. This location shall match the location of a pad in the PhyNet section that has a PortRef attribute with a value equal to the name of this Port | 0-1 |
