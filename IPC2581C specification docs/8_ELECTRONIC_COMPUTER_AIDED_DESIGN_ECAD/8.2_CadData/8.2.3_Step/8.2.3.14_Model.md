# 8.2.3.14 Model
 
A 3D definition of an item, consisting of the combination of one or more 3D shapes. The origin of the Model definition 
is the placement origin in the Step it is instantiated in. All units of length are per CadHeader units. 
 
## Attributes

| Attribute /  Element Name | Attribute /  Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Model | ModelType | A 3D definition of an item, consisting of the combination of one or more 3D shapes. The origin of the Model definition is the placement origin in the Step it is instantiated in. All units of length are per CadHeader units.  | 0-n |
| name | qualifiedNameType | A unique name for the model | 1-1 |
| SpecRef | SpecRefType | Reference to a unique specification that defines the Model’s material and/or other properties. Alternatively if the model is referenced by a modelRef attribute of a Component instance then that Component could have a matDes attribute that references a MatDes child of a BomItem which has an overarching SpecRef. | 0-1 |
| Extrusion | ExtrusionType | A nested element that describes a simple 3D shape, that is formed by extruding a given 2D shape to a given height | 1-n |
| startingHeight | nonNegativeDoubleType | The starting height of the extrusion, relative to zero height of the Model definition. The startingHeight shall be either zero (as the first shape) or equal to the height value of another shape, such that the shape is not floating in mid air. | 1-1 |
| height | nonNegativeDoubleType | The height to which the 2D shape is extruded above the startingHeight  | 1-1 |
| Feature | ABSTRACT | A substitution group that can be a StandardShape or  UserShape | 1-1 |
| Location | LocationType | A nested element with attributes x & y to define the location of the Feature in the local coordinate system of the model (relative to the origin of the Model)  | 1-1 |
| Xform | Xform type | An optional nested element that can define a rotation or scale in the XY plane of the 2D shape to be extruded. | 0-1 |
