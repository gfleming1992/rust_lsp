# 8.2.3.10 LayerFeature

The LayerFeature element contains all the physical features located on all layers. These features reference 
StandardPrimitive or UserPrimitive under the substitution group identification of StandardShape or 
UserShape. All shapes may be identified through a reference to predefined primitives contained in 
DictionaryStandard or DictionaryUser. Shapes may also be instantiated in the file by substitution of the 
Feature element with the shape name. All characteristics of any shape must be present when the substitution takes 
place. 
An individual LayerFeature can be thought of as artwork and these two-dimensional descriptions become the main 
body of the Step data. The information is contained in LayerFeature elements and includes several different 
elements, each corresponding to a layer defined earlier in the Layer element. 
The Set element defines modal attributes (attributes are in effect for all subsequent graphics contained in the set 
until changed). The only one important characteristic for the set graphic is the polarity attribute that can be 
POSITIVE (draw) or NEGATIVE (erase). The existence of negative features is the reason for the importance of the 
order.

## 8.2.3.10.3 Pad

The Pad element represents an individual pad. Pads are features with a center (x, y), a standard primitive shape 
or User defined shape either pre-defined in the DictionaryStandard, or DictionaryUser instanced at the time 
the Set is defined. The Pad may be changed through the Xform element (located, rotated, mirrored or scaled). 
Rotation is any number of degrees, although 90º multiples is the usual angle; positive rotation is always counter
clockwise as viewed from the board TOP (primary side). When mirror is set to MIRROR it indicates that all x 
dimensions are set to a–x value. For scaling the Pad, all x and y dimensions of a geometry are multiplied by the 
scale attribute. The scale factor does not apply to angular values. The Pad may have an appropriate pin attribute.

### BadBoardMark

The BadBoardMark element provides a list of images intended to represent a symbol known as a fiducial which 
works with equipment vision systems to identify whether the board in the array is good or not. The determination is 
usually made by the board fabricator and he covers the fiducial (BadBoardMark) to indicate that the board should 
not be assembled with components. 
These images are usually described in the form of a StandardShape and may appear on any Layer as a 
LayerFeature. The BadBoardMark may also be identified as a separate Set, thus arranging all of the 
BadBoardMark elements that identify good and bad boards on an assembly array, or manufacturing panel. 
If treated individually, BadBoardMark elements may appear multiple times within the LayerFeature Set.

works with assembly equipment vision systems to improve the positioning of the board or panel. These images are 
described in the form of a StandardShape and may appear on any Layer as a LayerFeature. The 
GlobalFiducial may also be identified as a separate Set, thus arranging all of the fiducials that position boards, 
assemblies, and assembly arrays in a panel format are considered in one LayerFeature Set. 
If treated individually, GlobalFiducial may appear multiple times within the LayerFeature Set.

made by the board fabricator. He makes sure that the GoodPanelMark fiducial is clearly visible to avoid having to 
check to see if there are any bad boards. 
These images are usually described in the form of a StandardShape and may appear on any Layer as a 
LayerFeature.  
  
#### Attributes

| Attribute /  Element Name | Attribute /  Element Type | Description | Occurrence |

the positioning of the component during the assembly operation. These images are usually described in the form of a 
StandardShape and may appear on any Layer as a LayerFeature. The LocalFiducial may also be 
identified as a separate Set, thus arranging all of the fiducials that position components or other specific features on 
a board, assembly array, or manufacturing panel. 
If treated individually, the LocalFiducial may appear multiple times within the LayerFeature Set. 
  
#### Attributes

| Attribute /  Element Name | Attribute /  Element Type | Description | Occurrence |

## 8.2.3.10.5 Hole

The Hole element describes the characteristics of a particular hole, including naming the hole description with a 
unique name that may be reused. The main purpose of including hole in the Set means that specific information can 
be described as all the particular holes in one set of data. In this instance, the layerRef of LayerFeature is to 
the Layer/Stackup element which describes the overallThickness for those holes that go entirely through the 
board. For those holes that are buried or blind vias, the appropriate Stackup reference shall be used as a part of 
the layerRef of the LayerFeature descriptions of holes. This concept permits a replacement of the Drill file 
that usually accompanies a data transfer transaction. 
The Hole element can occur multiple times within the LayerFeature element.

## 8.2.3.10.6 SlotCavity

The SlotCavity element describes a feature created by a machining operation that removes material from a bare 
board within a given shape. The shape is defined by the substitution group Feature, which can be either a user 
defined shape or a standard primitive shape. The feature can be plated or nonplated. The SlotCavity element can 
occur multiple times within the LayerFeature Set of a layer.  There are two types of features that it can define, 
as described below. 

### 8.2.3.10.6.1 Cut To Depth/Thickness

This operation is identified by the presence of the optional child substitution group Z_AxisDim, which can be either 
MaterialCut, which specifies a cut depth, or MaterialLeft, which specifies a thickness remaining. It can be 
performed on the full layer set that has completed the lamination process, or on a single layer or subset of layers prior 
to lamination. The cut can start from the top or bottom of the layer set, but not cut all the way through. If the cut is 
performed on a single layer then the optional attribute direction is required to specify whether the cut is DOWN 
(from the top) or UP (from the BOTTOM). The resulting open cavity has a flat floor that is parallel to the board surface, 
and sides that are perpendicular to the board surface. The location of the feature is typically planned so that internal 
copper etch is avoided when cutting. There may be a through hole drill or drills anywhere within the feature, added 
either before or after its creation. Note however that for a counterbore, which is specifically a circular cutout concentric 
to a single drill, the SecondaryDrill Specification should be used (see section 8.1.1.14). Examples are partial depth 
slots or grooves (but not v-grooves/v-scores – see V_Cut Specificaton, section 8.1.1.12). 

### 8.2.3.10.6.2 Cut To Span

The absence of the optional substitution group Z_AxisDim denotes a feature created by a machining operation that 
cuts a given shape completely through either all layers, or a subset of layers of a bare board.  A cut through a subset 
of layers implies sequential lamination, and may impact the order of construction of the layer stack. If the cut laminate 
then has additional layers added on either side then the cut feature becomes an embedded cavity. If additional layers 
are added to just one side then the feature becomes an open cavity.  
The extent of the cut through the layer stack is controlled by a Span child element of the routing layer containing the 
SlotCavity elements. The fromLayer attribute of Span denotes the first layer to be cut. The toLayer attribute 
denotes the last layer to be cut. If a Span child element is not present then the cut defaults to all the way through the 
board. Note that if a SlotCavity element with a Z_AxisDim child element is defined on a layer that has a Span 
child element then the Z_AxisDim shall take precedence, and the Span shall be ignored.

## 8.2.3.10.7 Features

An embedded element that defines a substitution group, whose characteristics are used to identify any 
StandardShape or UserShape. The description may come from a predefined stored element contained in 
DictionaryStandard or DictionaryUser or instantiated at the time a feature is described.

## 8.2.3.10.8 NetShort

An embedded element that defines an intentional physical and electrical short between two or more nets. Each 
NetShort represents a single refenced location, so that if the same nets are shorted in other locations then a 
NetShort element should be used to define each of those locations. A LayerRef child element defines the layer on 
which the short occurs. If the short is caused by a plated hole then it may span more than one layer, so each of those 
layers shall be referenced.
