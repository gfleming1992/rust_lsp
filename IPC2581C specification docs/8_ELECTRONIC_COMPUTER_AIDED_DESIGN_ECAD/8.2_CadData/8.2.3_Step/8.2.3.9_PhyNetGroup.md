# 8.2.3.9 PhyNetGroup

The PhyNetGroup element consists of various physical electrical connections. The group of nets may be combined 
from individual layers and submitted to a netlist analyzer or read from netlist files. Each PhyNetGroup, contains a 
set of one to many physical nets (PhyNets).
 
## Attributes

| Attribute /  Element Name | Attribute /  Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PhyNetGroup | PhyNetGroupType | A group of various physical nets combined in specific format and named accordingly.  | 0-n |
| name | qualifiedNameType | A unique name assigned to the PhyNetGroup. | 1-1 |
| optimized | boolean | An enumerated string is either “true” or “false” (part of the 3WC standard – must be lower case). True equals that the PhyNetGroup has been optimized by combining all PhyNets into a convenient description under the PhyNetGroup element; False indicates that the PhyNetGroup has not been optimized. If the attribute is not present the optimization condition is unknown. | 1-1 |
| PhyNet | PhyNetType | An embedded element that provides all the characteristics of a PhyNet describing the characteristics needed to interconnect components in the electronic product. | 1-n |
| name | qualifiedNameType | A unique name assigned to a specific PhyNet. | 1-1 |
| PhyNetPoint | PhyNetPointType | An embedded element that provides the details for the PhyNet location and characteristics. | 1-n |
 

## 8.2.3.9.1 PhyNet

The PhyNet element consists of one to many points that are essentially the nodes for the physical description of all 
the conductive elements that become a part of the Net on a particular surface of the board. The PhyNetPoint is 
only available on either top or bottom or both and, may also pertain to the concepts used for embedded passive or 
active component pin description.

True equals that the fiducial is being used as the probe point; False indicates that the fiducial is not available. If the attribute is not present the fiducial probing condition is unknown | 0-1 |
| test | boolean | An enumerated string is either “true” or “false” (part of the 3WC standard – must be lower case). True equals that the PhyNetPoint is part of the test sequence allowing for full nodal access, partial nodal access, or functional testing; False indicates that the PhyNetPoint is not part of the test sequence. If the attribute is not present the test condition is unknown. | 0-1 |
| staggerX | double | An X dimension that differs from the original X of the PhyNetPoint to indicate a probing location that varies from that specific point. | 0-1 |
