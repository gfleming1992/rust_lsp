# 8.2.3.4 Profile

The Profile element of the Step schema (StepTypeProfile) defines the exact periphery of the board or assembly and therefore all the characteristics of the Step element.

## Attributes

| Attribute /  Element Name | Attribute /  Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Profile | ContourType | The profile is a contourType and thus describes the periphery that encompasses all the elements in the Step. | 1-1 |
| Cutout | CutoutType | A polygon closed shape whose edges do not cross, which adopts the coordinates of the original polygon, however represents the absence of material within the original polygon shape. | 0-n |
