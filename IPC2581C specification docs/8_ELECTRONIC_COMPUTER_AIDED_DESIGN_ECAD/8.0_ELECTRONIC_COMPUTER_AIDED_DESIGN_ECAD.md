# 8 ELECTRONIC COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN (ECAD)

The `Ecad` section describes all Computer Aided Design data of the job, including graphical layer data, component locations, panel design, and more. It is typically the largest portion of an IPC-2581 file and depends on a clear understanding of Layers and Steps.
