| Measured                         | MeasuredType             | Nested element containing measurable characteristics for a `BomItem`.                                   | 0-n        |
| definitionSource                 | string                   | Source of the measurement information.                                                                | 0-1        |
| measuredCharacteristicName      | string                   | Name of the characteristic being measured (e.g., capacitance).                                         | 0-1        |
| measuredCharacteristicValue     | double                   | Nominal or target value of the measured characteristic.                                                | 0-1        |
| engineeringUnitOfMeasure         | string                   | Engineering unit of measure for the value.                                                             | 0-1        |
| engineeringNegativeTolerance     | double                   | Negative tolerance on the characteristic value.                                                        | 0-1        |
| engineeringPositiveTolerance     | double                   | Positive tolerance on the characteristic value.                                                        | 0-1        |
