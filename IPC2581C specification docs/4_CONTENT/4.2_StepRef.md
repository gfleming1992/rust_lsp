# 4.2 StepRef

The reference to the names of all Step elements used in the description of the Printed Circuit Assembly (PCA), the unpopulated board or other related information (e.g., documentation). In manufacturing, this basic Step is often nested inside a larger step (called array, or sub-panel), which in turn may be nested into another step (called a production panel). The Ecad element always contains at least one Step, but may contain several, some basic ones and others nesting previous steps.

The `StepRef` element, as it appears in the Content schema, references the job step’s names and thus the various steps that are included in the IPC-2581 file. All the graphical data of a IPC-2581 job are located inside steps that can be nested inside each other (PCB/Sub Panel/Panel, etc.). Steps are referenced in the Content schema (`StepRef`) as a string that relates to the details in the Ecad schema.
