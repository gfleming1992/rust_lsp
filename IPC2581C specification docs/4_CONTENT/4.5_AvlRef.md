# 4.5 AvlRef

The Avl section describes the Approved Vendor Lists for the materials used to fabricate the board and the assembly. The BOM lists include all the different components to be used on the board, arranged by part number, and materials used to fabricate the board arranged by part number. There are also BOMs for materials consumed by the fabrication and assembly processes. Each BOM has a corresponding list of approved vendors if the customer wishes to restrict the components and materials used for the electronic assembly to specific supplier(s). There shall be only one Avl section in an IPC-2581 file. It provides the names of each approved supplier and correlates them with the BOM that contains the material/component descriptions.

The Avl is used by the customer, the fabricator, and the assembler to coordinate the relationship with the bills of materials described in the IPC-2581 file.
