# 4.1 FunctionMode

The purpose of the Function Mode is to define which sections in the IPC-2581 schema are included in the IPC-2581 output file. Table 4 shows that the sections (table rows) to be included are determined by choosing one of seven modes (table columns) - UserDef, BOM, Stackup, Fabrication, Assembly, Test, and Stencil. The schema section options are detailed in Section 4.1.1. Descriptions of each mode are provided in Section 4.1.2. Referring to the table, the following are the four possible schema section values:

Y (in a green background) – included section. The section is either mandatory for the requirements of that mode, or mandatory to meet the IPC-2581 schema requirements
N (in a gray background) – excluded section. The section is considered never required for that mode
O (in a white background) – optional section. The section may provide additional data that may or may not be essential.

Every IPC-2581 export utility must adhere to the FunctionMode table when providing choices to the user, given what is available in the design data. However it is ultimately the user’s responsibility as to what is available in the data. For example if there is no Miscellaneous Fab data then it can’t be included in Fabrication Mode even though the table says it should be.
