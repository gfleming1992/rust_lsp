# 4.10 DictionaryFirmware

The **DictionaryFirmware** provides lookup information for predefined CachedFirmware elements. It is maintained as part of a substitution group schema, allowing firmware descriptions to be identified by unique characteristics and a specific name (`id`). These descriptions can be reused throughout the IPC-2581 file as needed. Each CachedFirmware within the DictionaryFirmware must have a unique `id`.

## Elements and Attributes

| Name               | Type                   | Description                                                                 | Occurrence |
|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| DictionaryFirmware | DictionaryFirmwareType | Contains all named CachedFirmware elements within the IPC-2581 file.         | 0-n        |
| EntryFirmware      | EntryFirmwareType      | Defines individual characteristics for a Firmware entry substitution.        | 0-n        |
| id                 | qualifiedNameType      | Unique name assigned as an id for XML schema substitution of firmware.       | 1-1        |
| CachedFirmware     | CachedFirmwareType     | Any CachedFirmware included in the DictionaryFirmware schema.                | 1-n        |

## Organization and Usage

DictionaryFirmware is organized according to substitution group criteria. CachedFirmware descriptions may be any hexEncodedBinary string, defined by specific characteristics. The `FirmwareRef` function is used in the IPC-2581 file body to reference a predefined CachedFirmware by its unique `id`. This allows either the use of a predefined CachedFirmware or the definition of firmware details for a particular component (identified by reference designator in the Step section). Each firmware description must include all relevant features according to the encoded definition rules.
