# 4.4 BomRef

The BOM section describes the Bill of Materials for the board. A bill of materials is a list of all the different components, materials, mechanical parts, or programmable software used in the electronic product. Components are arranged by the OEMDesignNumber or an alternate; materials for board fabrication or component attachment are arranged by their appropriate identifier. Each part number has a list of attributes and is accompanied by a list of the various specific uses or locations on the electronic product, each with its unique name.

The OEMDesignNumber is the part number from the original source OEM, not necessarily the component manufacturer part number.

Each `BomRef` element, as it appears in the Content schema, references one of the potentially many BOM categories and the number of items included in each category in the IPC-2581 file.
