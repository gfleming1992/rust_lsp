# 4.7 DictionaryLineDesc

The `DictionaryLineDesc` is intended to provide lookup information on predefined line descriptions. It is maintained as part of a substitution group schema. The intent is to have line descriptions available that are identified by their characteristics and a specific name (id). They may be reused throughout the file as appropriate. The name (id) of a LineDesc must be unique within the `DictionaryLineDesc`.

| Attribute / Element Name  | Attribute / Element Type     | Description                                                                                               | Occurrence |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| DictionaryLineDesc        | DictionaryLineDescType       | An element that contains substitution group information using line description criteria, predefined by the user for reuse in the file. | 0-1        |
| units                     | unitsType                    | An enumerated string that may be one of: `MILLIMETER`, `MICRON`, `INCH`.                                  | 1-1        |
| EntryLineDesc             | EntryLineDescType            | An element that establishes the individual characteristic associated with a line description substitution group that has been identified by the user in the IPC-2581 file. | 0-n        |
| id                        | qualifiedNameType            | The unique qualified name description assigned as an id for any LineDesc for XML schema substitution.      | 1-1        |
| LineDesc                  | LineDescType                 | An element that defines the LineEnd, LineWidth, and LineProperty characteristics to become part of the substitution group for defining line descriptions. | 1-n        |

**Example:**
```xml
<DictionaryLineDesc units="MILLIMETER">
  <EntryLineDesc id="FineLine">
    <LineDesc lineEnd="ROUND" lineWidth="0.05"/>
  </EntryLineDesc>
  <EntryLineDesc id="MediumLine">
    <LineDesc lineEnd="NONE" lineWidth="0.15"/>
  </EntryLineDesc>
  <EntryLineDesc id="HeavyLine">
    <LineDesc lineEnd="SQUARE" lineWidth="0.30"/>
  </EntryLineDesc>
</DictionaryLineDesc>
```

The organization of the `DictionaryLineDesc` is accomplished in accordance with the substitution group description criteria. The `LineDesc` description defines the `LineEnd` and `LineWidth` according to the specific characteristics defined in section 3.5.5.1. The `LineDescRef` function is used in the body of the IPC-2581 file when a specific `LineDesc` has been predefined, assigned a name, and the unique id is referenced in the file. This feature permits the use of either a predefined `LineDesc`, or defining the details of a `LineDesc` within the file. The description in the file must contain all the features of a line description under the rules of the `LineDesc` definition.
