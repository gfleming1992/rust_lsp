# 4.6 DictionaryColor

The `DictionaryColor` is intended to provide lookup information on predefined Color descriptions. It is maintained as part of a substitution group schema. The intent is to have color descriptions available that are identified by their three color hues and intensity characteristics and a specific name (id). They may be reused throughout the file as appropriate. The name (id) of a color must be unique within the `DictionaryColor`.

| EntryColor               | EntryColorType              | An element that establishes the individual characteristic associated with a color substitution that has been identified by the user in the IPC-2581 file. | 0-n        |

| Color                    | ColorType                   | A specific color identified through the instantiation of the three color spectrum (r, g, b).               | 1-n        |

The organization of the `DictionaryColor` is accomplished in accordance with the substitution group description criteria. The Color description may be any combination of the three color hues (red, green, and blue) at the appropriate intensity according to the values of the `r`, `g`, and `b` attributes. Refer to section 3.5.1.1 for details.
