# 4.9 DictionaryFont

The `DictionaryFont` is intended to provide lookup information on predefined font descriptions when the standard Helvetica font is not used. It is maintained as part of a substitution group schema. The intent is to have font descriptions available that are identified by their characteristics and a specific name (id). The reference is to individual Glyph characters or to a known font through reference to a URN. Font descriptions may be reused throughout the file as appropriate. The name (id) of a `FontDef` must be unique within the `DictionaryFont`.

| EntryFont                | EntryFontType               | An element that establishes the individual characteristic associated with a font substitution character or characters that have been identified by the user in the IPC-2581 file. | 0-n        |
| id                       | qualifiedNameType           | The unique qualified name description assigned as an id for any `EntryFont` for XML schema substitution. | 1-1        |
| FontDef                  | ABSTRACT                    | Part of the substitution group that permits the substitution of individual Glyphs (`EmbeddedFontDef`) or known font types through reference of a URN (`ExternalFontDef`). | 1-n        |

The organization of the `DictionaryFont` is accomplished in accordance with the substitution group description criteria. The `FontDef` description may be any character represented as a Glyph according to the specific characteristics identified in the following paragraphs. `FontDef` may also be a known font through reference of a URN. The `FontRef` element is used in the body of the IPC-2581 file when a specific font has been predefined, assigned a name, and the unique id is referenced in the file. This feature permits the substitution of the standard Helvetica font. Font descriptions are only contained in the `DictionaryFont` and are not instantiated in the body of the IPC-2581 file.
