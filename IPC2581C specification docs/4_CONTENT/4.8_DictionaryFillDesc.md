# 4.8 DictionaryFillDesc

The `DictionaryFillDesc` is intended to provide lookup information on predefined fill descriptions. It is maintained as part of a substitution group schema. The intent is to have fill descriptions available that are identified by their characteristics and a specific name (id). They may be reused throughout the file as appropriate. The name (id) of a `FillDesc` must be unique within the `DictionaryFillDesc`.

| Attribute / Element Name   | Attribute / Element Type     | Description                                                                                               | Occurrence |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| DictionaryFillDesc         | DictionaryFillDescType       | An element that contains substitution group information using fill description criteria, predefined by the user for reuse in the file. | 0-1        |
| units                      | unitsType                    | An enumerated string that may be one of: `MILLIMETER`, `MICRON`, `INCH`.                                  | 1-1        |
| EntryFillDesc              | EntryFillDescType            | An element that establishes the individual characteristic associated with a fill description substitution group that has been identified by the user in the IPC-2581 file. | 0-n        |
| id                         | qualifiedNameType            | The unique qualified name description assigned as an id for any `FillDesc` for XML schema substitution.   | 1-1        |
| FillDesc                   | FillDescType                 | An element that defines the FillProperty and Color characteristics to become part of the substitution group for defining fill descriptions. | 1-n        |

**Example:**
```xml
<DictionaryFillDesc units="MILLIMETER">
  <EntryFillDesc id="SolidFill">
    <FillDesc fillProperty="FILL"/>
  </EntryFillDesc>
  <EntryFillDesc id="HatchFill">
    <FillDesc fillProperty="HATCH" lineWidth="0.02" pitch1="0.08" angle1="135"/>
  </EntryFillDesc>
</DictionaryFillDesc>
```

The organization of the `DictionaryFillDesc` is accomplished in accordance with the substitution group description criteria. The `FillDesc` description defines the `FillProperty` and `Color` according to the specific characteristics defined in section 3.5.6.1. The `FillDescRef` function is used in the body of the IPC-2581 file when a specific `FillDesc` has been predefined, assigned a name, and the unique id is referenced in the file. This feature permits the use of either a predefined `FillDesc`, or defining the details of a `FillDesc` within the file. The description in the file must contain all the features of a fill description under the rules of the `FillDesc` definition.
