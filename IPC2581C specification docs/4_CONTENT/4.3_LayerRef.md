# 4.3 LayerRef

Layers, as the name implies, are sheets of two-dimensional data that, when laid on top of each other, create the Printed Circuit Assembly (unpopulated PCB and components or other related information). The `Layer` element appears in the IPC-2581 file as a sub-element of the `CadData` element.

The `LayerRef` element, as it appears in the Content schema, references all the file Layer unique names included in the IPC-2581 file.
