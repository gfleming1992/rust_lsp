# 6.1 HistoryRecord

The `HistoryRecord` element provides a sequential change number for the IPC-2581 file. The number is changed every time the controlled version of the IPC-2581 file is modified. Only the file owner is allowed to change the value of the `HistoryRecord/number`. The attributes of a `HistoryRecord` element are defined as follows:

| Attribute / Element Name            | Attribute / Element Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Occurrence |
