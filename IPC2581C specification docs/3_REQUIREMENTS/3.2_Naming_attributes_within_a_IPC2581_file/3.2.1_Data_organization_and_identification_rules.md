# 3.2.1 Data organization and identification rules

To prevent collisions between attributes having the same value used by the different partitions (boards, assemblies, or panels) within a single IPC-2581 file, an attribute prefix in the qualifiedNameType attribute type can be used to separate the values into ‘namespaces’ per partition. (Note that these ‘namespaces’ alter attribute values, so they should not to be confused with XML namespaces, which alter attribute or element names.)

This is necessary because an IPC-2581 file may contain information describing an arbitrary collection of partitions that are allowed within a single IPC-2581 file. That is, if an attribute is of type qualifiedNameType then it can be of the form A:B, where B is the attribute value, and A is a prefix that can make the value unique if repeated across multiple products in the same file.

For example, if 3 boards in the same file all have a refDes R1, then R1 could be represented by X:R1, Y:R1, Z:R1, where X,Y, and Z are unique prefixes assigned to each of the 3 boards. This mechanism also prepares the way for a distributed database of IPC-2581 design data in which the data can be trusted to be universally unambiguous.
