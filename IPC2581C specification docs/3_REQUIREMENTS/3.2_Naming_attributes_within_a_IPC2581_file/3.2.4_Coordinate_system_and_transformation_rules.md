# 3.2.4 Coordinate system and transformation rules

Any geometry defined in a IPC-2581 file is defined in a Cartesian coordinate system. The x coordinates become more positive going from left to right (west to east). The y coordinates become more positive going from bottom to top (south to north). The primary side (TOP) of the board, coupon, or panel is in the x-y plane of the coordinate system with the primary side facing up.

Each product in a 258X file is defined relative to a local coordinate system for the product. The point of origin of the product is located at (0,0) in the local coordinate system.
