# 3.2.3 Attribute base types (governing templates)

The attribute basic types (SimpleTypes) provided by XML Schema are defined by the W3C. They are easy to distinguish from the IPC-258X types because the W3C type is always prefixed with “xsd:”. The W3C datatypes are defined in http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema (XML Schema Part 2).

Table 2 defines those W3C basic types that are used to define attributes in the IPC-258X schema. The xsd:string type is constrained to create specific base types for special purpose strings, such as qualifiedNameType. The rules for special number types and the date format are also defined. Table 3 defines those basic types that have been standardized for use within the IPC-258X format.

## Table 2 Governing Template Basic Types Defined by W3C
- **xsd:string**: A W3C standard data type for a Unicode character string. The characters are from the UTF-8 character set as defined in http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2279.txt.
- **xsd:double**: A W3C standard data type for a binary floating-point number. The W3C definition of xsd:double is in http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/.
- **xsd:nonNegativeInteger**: A W3C standard data type for non-negative integer numbers. The W3C definition of xsd:nonNegativeInteger is in http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/.
- **xsd:positiveInteger**: A W3C standard data type for positive integer numbers. The W3C definition of xsd:positiveInteger is in http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/.
- **xsd:dateTime**: The W3C standard data type for the current date and time is xsd:dateTime. (See http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime-970915.html.)
- **xsd:anyURI**: A W3C standard data type for hyperlinks. The W3C definition of xsd:anyURI is in http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/.
- **xsd:unsignedByte**: The W3C standard for an unsigned byte (an unsigned 8 bit integer with a value between 0-255.) The W3C definition of xsd:unsignedByte is in http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/.
- **xsd:base64Binary**: The data is encoded using base64. (see IETF RFC 1421 for the base64 algorithm and http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#base64Binary)

## Table 3 Governing Template Basic Types Defined by IPC
- **qualifiedNameType**: The qualifiedNameType data type is a data type defined for the IPC-258X series. The type is a restricted xsd:string data type where the pattern of the string must match the regular expression as shown by the pattern value in the following definition:

```xml
<xsd:simpleType name = "qualifiedNameType">
  <xsd:restriction base = "xsd:string">
    <xsd:pattern value="([^:]+)(:[^:]+)?"/>
  </xsd:restriction>
</xsd:simpleType>
```

Examples of strings that match the pattern are: “prefix:name”, “name”, “3%+_?\22”.

- **nonNegativeDouble**: The nonNegativeDouble data type is defined for the 258X series. The type restricts an xsd:double to positive numbers, inclusive of 0. The non-negative range of values for IEEE doubles is defined as 0.0 ≤ value ≤ 3.4x10^38.
