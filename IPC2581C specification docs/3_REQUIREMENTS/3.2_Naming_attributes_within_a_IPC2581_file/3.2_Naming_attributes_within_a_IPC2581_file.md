# 3.2 Naming attributes within a IPC-2581 file

There is a type definition called qualifiedNameType that is used to name certain types of attributes in an IPC-2581 file. This type includes an attribute prefix in the name to allow for multiple products (boards, assemblies, or panels) to be defined in the single IPC-2581 file. See section 3.2.1 for more details.
