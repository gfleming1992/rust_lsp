# 3.1.7 XML Validation and Schema File Location

An attribute `schemaLocation` can be appended to the attribute list of the initial `<IPC-2581>` tag of any given IPC-2581 file. Its value must be two URIs separated by a space: the first URI, `http://webstds.ipc.org/2581`, is fixed as the namespace location, and the second, `http://www.ipc.org/2581/IPC-2581C.xsd`, is the location of the IPC-2581 revision C schema definition (.xsd) file. This enables validation tools to validate the file contents against the schema definition.

It is highly recommended that validation is performed to ensure your IPC-2581 files conform to the schema.

**Example of the `schemaLocation` attribute:**

```xml
<IPC-2581 revision="C"
          xmlns="http://webstds.ipc.org/2581"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://webstds.ipc.org/2581 http://www.ipc.org/2581/IPC-2581C.xsd">
```

**List of all current and previous revision schema files:**

- http://www.ipc.org/2581/IPC-2581C.xsd
- http://www.ipc.org/2581/IPC-2581B1.xsd
- http://www.ipc.org/2581/IPC-2581B.xsd
- http://www.ipc.org/2581/IPC-2581A.xsd
