# 3.1.5 Character set definition

The XML standard uses the Unicode character set. This character set covers the characters used in hundreds of written languages. The XML standard allows several of the Unicode encoding formats to be used in an XML file. IPC 2581 requires the use of the UTF-8 character encoding of the Unicode character set. Although comments and user assigned names may be in any language of choice, all qualified names or enumerated string names shall be in English only.
