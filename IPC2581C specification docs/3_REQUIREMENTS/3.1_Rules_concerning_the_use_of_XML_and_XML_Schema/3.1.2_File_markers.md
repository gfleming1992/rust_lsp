# 3.1.2 File markers

An optional checksum can be appended following the `</IPC-2581>` tag. The checksum is an MD5 message digest algorithm (see [Internet RFC 1321](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt)) that is base64 encoded. The checksum starts with the `<` character of the `<IPC-2581>` tag and ends with the `>` character of the closing `</IPC-2581>` tag. The checksum follows immediately after the `>` character of the closing `</IPC-2581>` tag.

The digest provides a 128-bit checksum of the IPC-2581 file contents. The MD5 signature must be base64 encoded (see [IETF RFC 1421](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1421) for the base64 algorithm) to convert the MD5 signature to a US-ASCII, base64 string. An end of line character will indicate the end of the base64 encoded MD5 signature.
