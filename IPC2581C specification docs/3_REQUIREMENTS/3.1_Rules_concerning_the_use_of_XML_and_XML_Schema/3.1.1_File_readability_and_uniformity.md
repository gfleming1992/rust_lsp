# 3.1.1 File readability and uniformity

A valid IPC-2581 file must conform to the W3C Canonical XML format. The format is defined by the [W3C XML Canonicalization specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n). Software tools exist that can take malformed XML and automatically generate Canonical XML.
