# 3.1.6 Child Element Order

The IPC-2581 schema uses the `<sequence>` order indicator throughout, which means that all child elements of a given parent element must be instantiated in an IPC-2581 file in the order in which they are defined in the schema.

For example, referring to section 8.2.3.10.3, consider the element `Pad`, which has four child elements: `Xform`, `Location`, `Feature`, and `PinRef`, defined in that order, as shown below:

```xml
<xsd:element name="Pad" type="PadType"/>
<xsd:complexType name="PadType">
    <xsd:sequence>
        <xsd:element ref="Xform" minOccurs="0"/>
        <xsd:element ref="Location"/>
        <xsd:element ref="Feature"/>
        <xsd:element ref="PinRef" minOccurs="0"/>
    </xsd:sequence>
</xsd:complexType>
```

The element `Xform`, if it exists (as it is optional), must occur first in any instance of `Pad`, followed by `Location`, and so on, as shown in the example below:

```xml
<Pad padstackDefRef="LS32X67">
    <Xform rotation="90.000"/>
    <Location x="7.1500" y="10.1500"/>
    <StandardPrimitiveRef id="RECTCENTER_3"/>
    <PinRef pin="34"/>
</Pad>
```

If the child elements appear in any other order in an IPC-2581 file, then the XML schema of that file is strictly invalid.
