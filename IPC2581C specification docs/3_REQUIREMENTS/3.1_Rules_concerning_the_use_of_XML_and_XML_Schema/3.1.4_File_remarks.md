# 3.1.4 File remarks

The IPC-2581 format permits file remarks using the standard XML commenting notation. They are only to be used to support debugging software. A parser may ignore and discard remarks when reading an IPC-2581 file. File remarks are never to be used to represent design or manufacturing information.
