# 3.4.10 Property

The Property element provides a group of attributes that may be used in order to describe the conditions that are to be associated with a particular specification. The attributes describe values, tolerances instructions and when they apply to a stackup, a reference is provided to which specific stackup layer the requirements apply. When the properties need to take into account other units or values a reference to those is also included. All attributes that are instantiated become a mandatory part of the specification to which they apply.

| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Property                | PropertyType            | A set of attributes that becomes a mandatory requirement to a specification and include values, tolerances, units and instructions. Appropriate references may also be provided. Since a specification may include several Property elements any ambiguity must be resolved prior to considering the impact the specification has on the products identified in the IPC-2581 file. | 1-1 |
| name                    | string                  | An optional name that can be given to the property being described. Only to be used for custom properties when the IPC-2581 file sender and receiver have a prior arrangement of what names are to be used. | 0-1 |
| value                   | double                  | A number that identifies the characteristics of the Value to be applied to any specified Unit attribute identified from the propertyUnitType enumerations. | 0-1 |
| text                    | string                  | Specific conditions or instructions that can be used as a property value when the value in non numeric or can be applied to the combination of Unit, Value and any tolerance attribute conditions. | 0-1 |
| unit                    | propertyUnitType        | A set of enumerated string descriptions that identify the Unit properties of the Value attribute requirement. They consist of MM | INCH | MICRON | MILS | OHMS | MHO/CM | SIEMENS/M | CELCIUS | FARANHEIT | PERCENT | Hz | DEGREES | RMAX | RZ | RMS | SECTION | CLASS | ITEM | GAUGE | IN-LB | IN-OZ | FT-LB | N-m | N-cm | MIN | MAX | OZ | OZ/SQ-FT | GRAMS | HENRYS | AMPS | WATTS | VOLTS | FARAD | dB | dB/INCH | dB/MM | OTHER. If OTHER is noted a comment attribute is required. | 0-1 |
| tolPlus                 | nonNegativeDouble       | The plus tolerance that may be applied to the nominal number defined in the Value attribute setting the upper control limit. | 0-1 |
| tolMinus                | nonNegativeDouble       | The minus tolerance that may be applied to the nominal number defined in the Value attribute setting the lower control limit. | 0-1 |
| tolPercent              | boolean                 | An enumerated string is either “true” or “false” (part of the 3WC standard – must be lower case). True means that the attribute(s) tolPlus and/or tolMinus are a percentage. False indicates that they represent a nonNegativeDouble. The Default is “false”. | 0-1 |
| refUnit                 | propertyUnitType        | A second Unit set of enumerated string descriptions that are to be used as reference Unit properties of the basic attribute requirement. They consist of MM | INCH | MICRON | MILS | OHMS | MHO/CM | SIEMENS/M | CELCIUS | FARANHEIT | PERCENT | Hz | DEGREES | RMAX | RZ | RMS | SECTION | CLASS | ITEM | GAUGE | IN-LB | IN-OZ | FT-LB | N-m | N-cm | MIN | MAX | OZ | OZ/SQ-FT | GRAMS | HENRYS | AMPS | WATTS | VOLTS | FARAD | dB | dB/INCH | dB/MM | OTHER. If OTHER is noted a comment attribute is required. | 0-1 |
| refValue                | double                  | A second Value number that is to be used as reference Value in considering the properties of the basic attribute requirement. | 0-1 |
| refText                 | string                  | A second set of instructions that need to be applied when considering the references established for the Value number, unit, tolerances or instructions applied to the properties of the basic attribute requirement. | 0-1 |
| layerOrGroupRef         | qualifiedNameType       | A reference to the identification of the unique name assigned to a specific layer or group to which the properties of the specification are to be applied. | 0-1 |
| comment                 | string                  | A description of any unit or refUnit characteristic that is different or supplements the propertyUnitType enumerations | 0-1 |
