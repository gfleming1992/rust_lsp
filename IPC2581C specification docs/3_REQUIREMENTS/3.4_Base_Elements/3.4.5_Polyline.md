| Polyline                | PolylineType            | The Polyline element consists of a series of lines that define a particular grouping configuration. These line segments do NOT result in a closed shape, however they can be pre-defined and re-used as needed. The lineWidth and lineEnd of the Polyline are defined at the time the Polyline is instantiated or predefined. | 1-1 |
| PolyBegin               | PolyBeginType           | The PolyBegin element defines the starting point of the polyline. | 1-1 |
| PolyStep                | ABSTRACT                | The PolyStep element is a substitution group that defines a curved (PolyStepCurve) or straight line (PolyStepSegment) continuation of the polyline. The final X and final Y coordinates must NOT match those of the PolyBegin element to signify that the shape is open | 1-n |
| LineDescGroup           | ABSTRACT                | A substitution group that specifies the properties (width, style, etc.) of the line that forms the polyline. The elements to be substituted are either LineDesc or LineDescRef. Refer to section 3.5.5 LineDesGroup | 1-1 |
