# 3.4.4 Polygon

A polygon is a closed shape whose edges do not cross.

| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Polygon                 | PolygonType             | A closed shape whose edges do not cross, the coordinates of which are defined relative to the local coordinate system of the polygon. | 1-1 |
| PolyBegin               | PolyBeginType           | The PolyBegin element defines the starting point of the polygon. | 1-1 |
| PolyStep                | ABSTRACT                | The PolyStep element is a substitution group that defines a curved (PolyStepCurve) or straight line (PolyStepSegment) continuation of the polygon. Refer to section 3.5.7 PolyStep. The final X and final Y coordinates must match those of the PolyBegin element to signify that the shape is closed. | 1-n |
| Xform                   | XformType               | An element that provides the ability to reset the point of origin of a predefined target that can be scaled, mirror imaged or rotated. Note: the use of this is not recommended, as it may be removed in the next revision. It is better to assign the Xform to the shape instance. | 0-1 |
| LineDescGroup           | LineDescGroupType       | A substitution group that specifies either LineDesc or LineDescRef. Refer to section 3.5.5 LineDesGroup | 0-1 |
| FillDescGroup           | FillDescGroupType       | A substitution group that specifies either FillDesc or FillDescRef. Refer to section 3.5.6 FillDesGroup | 0-1 |
