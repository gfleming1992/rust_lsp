# 3.4.2 Arc

The Arc element describes a curved line relative to a center of rotation. The start and end points of the line forming the arc are defined, as well as the center of rotation and description of the line.

| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |

| Arc                     | ArcType                 | The Arc element represents an arc. Arcs are curves (defined by three sets of coordinates: startX, startY, endX, endY and centerX, centerY. The width of the arc is set by the LineDescGroup substitution group or applied when the Arc is instantiated. | 1-1 |
| startX                  | double                  | Beginning x-coordinate of the Arc. | 1-1 |
| startY                  | double                  | Beginning y-coordinate of the Arc. | 1-1 |
| endX                    | double                  | Ending x-coordinate of the Arc. | 1-1 |
| endY                    | double                  | Ending y-coordinate of the Arc. | 1-1 |
| centerX                 | double                  | The X location for the origin of the radius of the circular Arc. | 1-1 |
| centerY                 | double                  | The Y location for the origin of the radius of the circular Arc. | 1-1 |
| clockwise               | Boolean                 | A required boolean to set the direction of rotation of the curve. If “true” then the direction of rotation is clockwise. If “false” then the direction of rotation is counterclockwise | 1-1 |
| LineDescGroup           | ABSTRACT                | A substitution group that specifies the properties (width, style, etc.) of the line that forms the arc. The elements to be substituted are either LineDesc or LineDescRef. Refer to section 3.5.5 LineDesGroup | 1-1 |

Example:
```xml
<Arc startX = "8.0" startY = "0.0" endX = "-8.0" endY = "0.0" centerX = "0.0" centerY = "0.0" clockwise = "false">
     <LineDescRef id = "MediumLine"/>
</Arc>
<Arc startX = "-8.0" startY = "0.0" endX = "0.0" endY = "8.0" centerX = "0.0" centerY = "0.0" clockwise = "true">
     <LineDesc lineEnd = "ROUND" lineWidth = "1.0"/>
</Arc>
```
