# 3.4.6 Cutout

A Cutout element defines a polygon closed shape whose edges do not cross. Cutout elements must always be paired with a sibling Polygon element, with co-ordinates and size such that the cutout shapes are fully enclosed within the boundry of the polygon, so that the cutouts represent the absence of material within that polygon.

| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Cutout                  | PolygonType             | A polygon closed shape whose edges do not cross, which represents the absence of material within the sibling polygon shape. | 1-1 |
| PolyBegin               | PolyBeginType           | The PolyBegin element defines the starting point of the cutout | 1-1 |
| PolyStep                | ABSTRACT                | The PolyStep element is a substitution group that defines a curved (PolyStepCurve) or straight line (PolyStepSegment) continuation of the polygon. Refer to section 3.5.7 PolyStep. The final X and final Y coordinate must match those of the PolyBegin element to signify that the shape is closed. | 1-n |
| LineDescGroup           | LineDescGroupType       | A substitution group that specifies either LineDesc or LineDescRef. Refer to section 3.5.5 LineDesGroup | 0-1 |
| FillDescGroup           | FillDescGroupType       | A substitution group that specifies either FillDesc or FillDescRef. Refer to section 3.5.6 FillDesGroup | 0-1 |
