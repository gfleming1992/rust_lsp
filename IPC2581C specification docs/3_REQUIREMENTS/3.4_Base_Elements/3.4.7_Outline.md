# 3.4.7 Outline

The Outline element consists of the following characteristics using a Polygon shape to represent a closed shaped group of lines.

| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Outline                 | OutlineType             | An element that has as its sub elements the Polygon and LineDesc elements in order to define a closed shape that has a line width. | 1-1 |
| Polygon                 | PolygonType             | The standard description for the Polygon characteristic must be a closed shape. The point of origin of the shape is identified as the 0:0 coordinate. The element includes the start of the polygon definition (PolyBegin) and the appropriate number of PolySteps to complete the closed shape. The lineWidth is through the LineDesc substitution group or defined at a time when the Polygon is instantiated. | 1-1 |
| LineDescGroup           | LineDescGroupType       | A substitution group that specifies the properties (width, style, etc.) of the line that forms the outline. The elements to be substituted are either LineDesc or LineDescRef. Refer to section 3.5.4.1 LineDesGroup | 1-1 |

Example:
```xml
<Outline>
     <Polygon>
          <PolyBegin x = "0.0" y = "6.4"/>
          <PolyStepSegment x = "12.6" y = "6.4"/>
          <PolyStepCurve x = "14.8" y = "4.2" centerX = "12.6" centerY = "4.2" clockwise = "true"/>
          <PolyStepSegment x = "14.8" y = "0.0"/>
          <PolyStepSegment x = "0.0" y = "0.0"/>
          <PolyStepSegment x = "0.0" y = "6.4"/>
     </Polygon>
     <LineDescRef id = "FineLine"/>
</Outline>
<Outline>
     <Polygon>
          <PolyBegin x = "-10.4" y = "-2.0"/>
          <PolyStepSegment x = "-10.4" y = "0.0"/>
          <PolyStepCurve x = "10.4" y = "0.0" centerX = "0.0" centerY = "0.0" clockwise = "true"/>
          <PolyStepSegment x = "10.4" y = "-2.0"/>
          <PolyStepSegment x = "0.0" y = "-6.0"/>
          <PolyStepSegment x = "-10.4" y = "-2.0"/>
     </Polygon>
     <LineDesc lineEnd = "ROUND" lineWidth = "0.2"/>
</Outline>
