# 3.3.3 The mirror attribute

The mirror attribute is of data type boolean. This type is an enumerated string indicating true or false. The default value for MIRROR is “false”. When mirror is set to “true”  it indicates that all x dimensions are set to a –x value. The proper interpretation of the mirror and rotate attributes are shown in Figure 3. The example shows a unique artwork (14-pin DIP device) placed on the top and bottom of a board at 90.00° rotations.
