# 3.3.5 The x and y Location attributes

The xLocation and yLocation attributes are of type xsd:double. They define the x and y position where a feature, component, text or other shape is placed. The xLocation and yLocation coordinate positions a shape by its original origin or its modified origin (x and y Offset) relative to the origin of the image upon which the feature, component etc. is to be located. Mirroring, rotating, and scaling may all apply to the location of the shape as indicated by the Xform.
