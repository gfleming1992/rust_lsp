# 3.3.1 The x and y Offset attributes

The xOffset and yOffset attributes are of type xsd:double. They define the x and y offset of a shape relative to the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system. The definition of shapes can be nested and the x and y attributes are always interpreted relative to the local coordinate system of the shape to which the transformation applies. The default value for x and y is 0.0.
