# 3.3 Transformation characteristics (Xform)

The Xform element defines a transformation that may be used throughout this specification to define a modification of the original stored data in the Dictionaries, the location and orientation of physical features. Features, Shapes, Primitives or other graphics in the file may manipulate relative to their local Cartesian coordinate system by the values set in the transform. The Xform element can define a modification of the pre-defined feature’s point of origin, and then apply rotation, mirroring, scaling and location (x and y) of the image.

The units of measure are defined in the CadHeader as an attribute that describes the details of all the features in the Ecad section. In addition, units of measure are also defined in each of the Dictionaries that contain graphical information. These are DictionaryStandard, DictionaryUser, DictionaryFont, and DictionaryLineDesc. When a pre-defined image from one of the dictionaries is used in the Ecad section, the units of measure must match.

The order of the transformation shall always follow the order of the fields in the description. This would be to 1) modify the origin; 2) apply rotation; 3) mirror image; and 4) scale.

| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Xform                   | XformType               | An element that provides the ability to reset the point of origin of a predefined target that can be scaled, mirror imaged or rotated. | 0-1 |
| xOffset                 | double                  | The x offset of a previously defined shape relative to its original point of origin in order to define a new origin used for rotation, mirroring, scaling and location. The CadHeader defines the units of measure. | 0-1 |
| yOffset                 | double                  | The y offset of a previously defined shape relative to its original point of origin in order to define a new origin used for rotation, mirroring, scaling and location. The CadHeader defines the units of measure. | 0-1 |
| rotation                | nonNegativeDouble Type  | Defines the rotation of a shape about the local origin in degrees. Positive rotation is always counter-clockwise as viewed from the board TOP (primary side). Degree accuracy is expressed as a two place decimal i.e., 45.15; 62.34 | 0-1 |
| mirror                  | boolean                 | An enumerated string is either “true” or “false” (part of the 3WC standard – must be lower case). True indicates that the image is mirrored; False indicates that it is not. Mirror is implemented as “false” by default and MUST be set to “true” if the features/components are to be inverted when applied to a component it is placed on the underside of its given layer. When the given layer is not the bottom layer then the component is embedded within the PCB substrate. | 0-1 |
| scale                   | scaleType               | An attribute that defines a “double” dimension whose minExclusiveValue=0.0 representing the multiplication factor of all x and y dimensions. The scale factor does not apply to angular values. | 0-1 |
| faceUp                  | boolean                 | An attribute applicable to the placement ot a component. When false the component is placed “face down”, which is the default orientation per the library definition. When true the component is placed on its back, so that any pins on its underside are now on its topside and vice versa. | 0-1 |
