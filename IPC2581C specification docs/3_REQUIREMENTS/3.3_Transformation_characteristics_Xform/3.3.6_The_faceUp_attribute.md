# 3.3.6 The faceUp attribute

As with the mirror attribute, when faceUp is set to true in the Xform of a component then all x dimensions are set to a –x value. The difference is that mirror places the component on the underside of the mounting layer whereas faceUp places the component on the same side as the mounting layer.

There is one exception, which is when both mirror and faceUp are true. In this case the –x transformations cancel each other out, resulting in no  -x transformation, and the mirror placement wins, so that the component is placed on the underside of the layer. The result is an effective shift in the -y direction such that the component “moves through” the mounting layer to its other side.
