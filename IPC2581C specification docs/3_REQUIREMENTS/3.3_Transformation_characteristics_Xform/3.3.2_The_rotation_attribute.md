# 3.3.2 The rotation attribute

The rotation attribute is of type nonNegativeDouble that defines the rotation of a shape about the local origin. The interpretation of the value is set globally in the file to units of degrees. The range of the rotation parameter for DEGREES is 0.00 to 360.00 expressed as a nonNegativeDouble with an accuracy of a two place decimal. Positive rotation is always counter-clockwise as viewed from the board TOP (primary side), even if the component that is being rotated is on the board BOTTOM (secondary side). Rotation defaults to 0.0, and can be applied to text, or any physical shape.
