# 3.5.11.1 Text

Text elements are defined with a bounding rectangle. The lowerLeftX, lowerLeftY, upperRightX, and upperRightY coordinates define the BoundingBox. All text, including line width of strokes, must fit within the BoundingBox. Anything outside is clipped. Each Text entry in DictionaryUser has a unique id and consists of the following characteristics:

Text may be used as a layer feature or in a Package description, with all Xform and BoundingBox characteristics applying. When used as a simple string attribute, location, font, and Xform are not required. The attribute textString should be enclosed in the textbox, and anything outside the clipping box will be clipped. Both upper and lower case letters, including descenders, must be inside the BoundingBox.
