# 3.5.6.1 FillDesc

The FillDesc element is used throughout the IPC-2581 file to establish the characteristics of FillProperty and Color descriptions.

| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|
| FillDesc                | FillDescType            | An element that defines the characteristics of a fill property. The Units are defined when the LineDesc is instantiated; Units is a part of the characteristics when FillDesc is contained in the DictionaryFillDesc. | 1-1 |
| fillProperty            | fillPropertyType        | The texture of the fill is one of HOLLOW, HATCH, MESH, FILL or VOID. The value VOID is reserved for Cutout elements – refer to section 3.4.5 Cutout. The default is FILL. | 1-1 |
| lineWidth               | nonNegativeDoubleType   | The width of the lines used in a HATCH or MESH. (This attribute only applies to the fill types HATCH and MESH.) | 0-1 |
| pitch1                  | nonNegativeDoubleType   | The distance between the first set of lines in a HATCH or MESH. The default pitch between the hatch lines is 4 times the lineWidth. (This attribute only applies to the fill types HATCH and MESH.) | 0-1 |
| pitch2                  | nonNegativeDoubleType   | The distance between the second set of lines in a MESH. The default pitch between the hatch lines is 4 times the lineWidth. (This attribute only applies to the fill type MESH.) | 0-1 |
| angle1                  | angleType               | The angle of a set of lines in a HATCH or a MESH. The angle is measured relative to the x-axis of the local coordinate system. The range of values is limited to between 0 and 180 degrees. The default is 45 degrees. (This attribute only applies to the fill types HATCH and MESH.) | 0-1 |
| angle2                  | angleType               | The angle of the second set of lines in a MESH. The angle is measured relative to the x-axis of the local coordinate system. The angle must be between 90 and 180 degrees. The default is 135 degrees. (This attribute only applies to the fill type MESH.) | 0-1 |
| ColorGroup              | ABSTRACT                | An element that is a substitution group which can be used to define a particular Color for the shape being filled. In the absence of this element the default color is black, but this can be overridden by a color set at the parent element, or above, level. | 0-1 |
