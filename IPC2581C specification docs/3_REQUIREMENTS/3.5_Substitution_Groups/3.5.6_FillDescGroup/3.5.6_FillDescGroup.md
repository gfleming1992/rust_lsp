# 3.5.6 FillDescGroup

The FillDescGroup substitution specifies either FillDesc or FillDescRef. The FillDesc element provides the FillProperties, LineDesc and Color characteristics of any feature that requires that definition. Fill descriptions are a part of the StandardPrimitives, any UserPrimitive closed shape and Set element definitions. The FillDescRef requires an “id” that must be unique within the IPC-2581 file.
