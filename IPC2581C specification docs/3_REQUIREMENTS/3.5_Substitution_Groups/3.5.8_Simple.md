# 3.5.8 Simple

The Simple substitution group consists of base elements: **Arc**, **Line**, **Outline**, and **Polyline**. These elements are used in DfxMeasurement, Glyph, and Slot elements, and may also be identified as UserPrimitive, UserShape, or Feature. When predefined in DictionaryUser or DictionaryFont, the units must match those of the dictionary.

| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Arc                     | ArcType                 | Arc elements are curves defined by three sets of coordinates: startX, startY, endX, endY, and centerX, centerY. The width of the arc is applied when instantiated or predefined. | 0-n |
| Line                    | LineType                | Line elements are individual line segments. The lineWidth and lineEnd conditions are defined when instantiated or predefined. The lineEnd default is ROUND. | 0-n |
| Outline                 | OutlineType             | Outline has Polygon and LineDescGroup as children. Polygon must be a closed shape, with origin at 0:0. Includes PolyBegin and PolySteps to complete the closed shape. lineWidth is defined when instantiated or predefined. | 0-n |
| Polyline                | PolylineType            | Polyline consists of a series of lines that do not result in a closed shape. Can be predefined and reused. lineWidth and lineEnd are defined when instantiated or predefined. | 0-n |

**Example:**
```xml
<Arc startX="0" startY="0" endX="10" endY="10" centerX="5" centerY="5" width="0.2"/>
<Line startX="0" startY="0" endX="10" endY="0" lineWidth="0.1" lineEnd="ROUND"/>
<Outline>
  <Polygon>
    <PolyBegin x="0" y="0"/>
    <PolyStepSegment x="10" y="0"/>
    <PolyStepSegment x="10" y="10"/>
    <PolyStepSegment x="0" y="10"/>
    <PolyStepSegment x="0" y="0"/>
  </Polygon>
  <LineDescGroup>
    <LineDesc lineWidth="0.1"/>
  </LineDescGroup>
</Outline>
<Polyline>
  <Line startX="0" startY="0" endX="10" endY="0"/>
  <Line startX="10" startY="0" endX="10" endY="10"/>
</Polyline>
```
