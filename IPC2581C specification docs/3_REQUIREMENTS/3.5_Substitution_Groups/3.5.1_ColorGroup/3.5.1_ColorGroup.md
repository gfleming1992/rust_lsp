# 3.5.1 ColorGroup

The ColorGroup substitution group consists of three elements, Color, ColorRef and ColorTerm, with which it is possible to define a color in the body of the IPC-2581 standard. ColorGroup is used by the FillDesc, Set, Layerfeature, Text, and General (specification) elements.

| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Color                   | ColorType               | The description of a specific color using the three attributes of red, green, and blue. | 0-n |
| ColorRef                | ColorRefType            | The id of a previously defined ‘rgb’ color stored in the DictionaryColor. | 0-n |
| ColorTerm               | ColorTermType           | A color name which is one of an enumerated list of basic color terms. | 0-n |

There is no default color. If no color is defined anywhere within the XML hierarchy of a given object then the implementing system’s color setting shall be used. If different colors are set at different levels within the XML hierarchy of a given object then the value set at the lowest level shall take precedence.
