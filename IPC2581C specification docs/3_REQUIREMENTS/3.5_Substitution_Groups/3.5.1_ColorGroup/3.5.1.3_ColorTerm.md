# 3.5.1.3 ColorTerm

The ColorTerm element is used to describe a color as one of 11 basic color terms, from an enumerated list. It can be used by a customer to describe to a supplier the required color of a material, or physical object, when the precise hue of the color can be left up to the supplier. A 12th enumerated list member OTHER can be used if an additional color term is required, in which case a description must be given in the comment attribute.
