The Fiducial substitution group consists of four elements that may be used to replace the Fiducial element. When the Fiducial element is substituted, it shall be by either a BadBoardMark, GlobalFiducial, GoodPanelMark, or LocalFiducial fiducial type. The Fiducial elements contain an Xform and a substitution capability to a StandardShape. An optional Pin attribute allows reference to a component pin.

| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|
| BadBoardMark            | FiducialType            | A set of Standard Shapes used as an aid to the board assembler by defining those boards in a panel that did not pass inspection or electrical test. The fiducial shape is positioned near each board in the assembly panel array and covered over to signify that the board is defective. | 0-n |
| GlobalFiducial          | FiducialType            | A set of Standard Shapes used in the description, arrangement or positioning of a group of features on an individual board, assembly, or panel. | 0-n |
| GoodPanelMark           | FiducialType            | A single Standard Shape used to define a panel where all boards on the panel are good. The fiducial is positioned once on the panel and enables reduction in inspection time. | 0-n |
| LocalFiducial           | FiducialType            | A set of fiducials (usually a pair) used in the description and arrangement of features related to a specific component on a board, assembly, or panel which aide in the location/positioning process. | 0-n |
