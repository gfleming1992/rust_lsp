| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Moire                   | MoireType               | Series of circles defined by ring count, spacing, and width. May contain crosshair. | 1-1 |
| diameter                | nonNegativeDoubleType   | Diameter of the outermost circle. | 1-1 |
| ringWidth               | nonNegativeDoubleType   | Width of the line for each circle. | 1-1 |
| ringGap                 | nonNegativeDoubleType   | Gap between circle lines (centerline to centerline). Must be larger than ringWidth. | 1-1 |
| ringNumber              | nonNegativeInteger      | Number of rings. | 1-1 |
| lineWidth               | nonNegativeDoubleType   | Line width for crosshair. Default is 0. | 0-1 |
| lineLength              | nonNegativeDoubleType   | Length of crosshair lines. | 0-1 |
| lineAngle               | angleType               | Angle for crosshair rotation (counterclockwise). Default is 0°. | 0-1 |
