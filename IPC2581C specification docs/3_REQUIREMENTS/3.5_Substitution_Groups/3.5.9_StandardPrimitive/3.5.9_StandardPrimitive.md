# 3.5.9 StandardPrimitive

There are sixteen Standard Primitives defined in IPC-2581. Any primitive shape may be substituted when StandardPrimitive is called for in the schema. Each shape has attributes identifying its physical requirements. StandardPrimitives may be predefined, given a unique "id", and contained in DictionaryStandard. All shapes are developed in accordance with their description requirements and preferred orientation.

Each StandardPrimitive shape has specific attributes and may include LineDescGroup and FillDescGroup substitution groups. See subsections for detailed descriptions and XML examples for each shape.
