# 3.5.5 LineDescGroup

The LineDescGroup substitution specifies the LineDesc or LineDescRef. The LineDesc specifies the LineWidth, LineEnd and LineProperty characteristics of any feature that requires that definition. Line descriptions are a part of the Outline, Polyline and Set element definitions. The substitution is also instantiated by the substitution group Simple which calls for Arc, Line, Outline and Polyline. In addition to UserPrimitive, StandardPrimitive also makes use of the line descriptions when required. The LineDescRef requires an “id” that must be unique within the IPC-2581 file.
