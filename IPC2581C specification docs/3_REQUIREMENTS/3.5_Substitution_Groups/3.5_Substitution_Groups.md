# 3.5 Substitution Groups

The IPC-2581 uses the concept of substitution within the XML schema. Various groups of elements have been identified in the body of the standard and have been designated as having a specific focus or purpose. Within the schema, these substitution groups are provided with a name. When a group exists and if they are required according to the instances of the schema, it is mandatory that the substitution name be replaced by one of the acceptable descriptions identified within the group.

A substitution group consists of two types of elements: a “head” and elements which may substitute for the head. When the head is denoted as ABSTRACT, the substitution is required, rather than optional. In IPC-2581, the heads of all substitution groups are ABSTRACT. Thus, a valid instance document is not allowed to contain a StandardPrimitive element, but instead, (where StandardPrimitive is called for in the schema) a Triangle, Diamond, Hexagon, etc. must be used.

There are 13 substitution groups within the IPC-2581 schema. These are shown in the following table:

| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|
