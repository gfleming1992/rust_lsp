# 3.5.7.1 PolyStepCurve

A PolyStepCurve is a continuation of the linear description of a Polyline or Polygon if the next portion to be defined is an arc. The end point of the arc is defined as well as the center of rotation. The start point of the arc is defined by either a PolyBegin element or the previous PolyStep.

| PolyStepCurve           | PolyStepCurveType       | The continuation of the linear description of a Polyline or Polygon if the next portion to be defined is an arc. The end point of the arc is defined as well as the center of location. | 1-1 |
| x                       | Double                  | The X end point of the curve. | 1-1 |
| y                       | Double                  | The Y end point of the curve. | 1-1 |
| centerX                 | Double                  | The X point that is the center of rotation of the curve. | 1-1 |
| centerY                 | Double                  | The Y point that is the center of rotation of the curve. | 1-1 |
| clockwise               | Boolean                 | A required boolean to set the direction of rotation of the curve. If “true” then the direction of rotation is clockwise. If “false” then the direction of rotation is counterclockwise | 1-1 |
