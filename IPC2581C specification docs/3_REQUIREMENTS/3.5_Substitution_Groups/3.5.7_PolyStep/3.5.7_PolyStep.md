# 3.5.7 PolyStep

The Polystep substitution consists of defining either a Line or an Arc as the continuation of a Polyline or Polygon description. The location information is interpreted as being the end point to which the curve (Arc), or segment (Line) is drawn. Straight or curved line segments must not cross. The substitution may take place anywhere within the file where the elements Polyline and Polygon occur. This action includes the dictionaries where graphic descriptions are predefined. The Units of measure must be consistent with the Units parameter of the three dictionaries where this substitution can take place; DictionaryStandard, DictionaryUser, and DictionaryFont.
