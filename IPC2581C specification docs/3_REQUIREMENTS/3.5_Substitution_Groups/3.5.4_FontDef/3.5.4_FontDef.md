# 3.5.4 FontDef

The FontDef substitution group consists of the description of a font that is different than the standard Helvetica and which is contained in the DictionaryFont. Fonts in the dictionary have an “id” which is called out when a FontRef is instantiated. FontRef is used by the element Text, which is called for in SilkScreen and AssemblyDrawing. Text can also be substituted whenever a UserPrimitive, UserShape or Feature is called for.

| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|
| FontDefEmbedded         | FontDefEmbeddedType     | A description of a font using individual characters that are defined in accordance with the Glyph element and are contained in the DictionaryFont. Fonts must be predefined and may not be instantiated as part of the data in the file. | 0-n |
| FontDefExternal         | FontDefExternalType     | A reference to an external font description through the instantiation of a URN. The font is named and the reference is contained in the DictionaryFont. The appropriate character set is defined by the URN. External Fonts must be predefined and may not be instantiated as part of the data in the file. | 0-n |

The term "Uniform Resource Name" (URN) refers to the subset of URI that are required to remain globally unique and persistent even when the resource ceases to exist or becomes unavailable. A URI can be further classified as a locator, a name, or both. The term "Uniform Resource Locator" (URL) refers to the subset of URI that identify resources via a representation of their primary access mechanism (i.e., their network "location"), rather than identifying the resource by name or by some other attribute(s) of that resource.
