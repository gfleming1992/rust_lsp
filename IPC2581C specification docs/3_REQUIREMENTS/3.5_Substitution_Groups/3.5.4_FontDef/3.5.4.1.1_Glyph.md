# 3.5.4.1.1 Glyph

The Glyph character set is a group of user defined characters that will be referenced by the text command in the file. Glyph permits the user to define a special set of characters that need description as a part of the IPC-2581 file. Each character is in a BoundingBox that contains all the line strokes needed to completely define each character in the set. The point of origin is the lower left hand corner of the BoundingBox. The lowerLeftX and lowerLeftY point of origin will be used to position, rotate or mirror image all Glyph characters.
