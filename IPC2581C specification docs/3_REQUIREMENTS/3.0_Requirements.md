# REQUIREMENTS

The XML schema contained in this document describes the structure of a generic computer-aided manufacturing exchange format, called IPC-2581. The document specifies data elements specifically designed to establish the information exchange related to the data needed by printed board manufacturing, and assembly including inspection of those products.

The XML schema defines the configuration of mandatory and optional elements, as well as mandatory and optional attributes. The Top Level (TopElement) of the schema contains six major elements. The schema notation specifies that the 6 top-level elements are required to appear in the order shown in Figure 1. The order of appearance in the file is significant. For instance, the appearance of graphics on a layer is dependent on the order of appearance in the file. The order is also important because elements often reference information that is defined elsewhere in the file in order to eliminate redundancy within the file. The file is structured to allow all references to be resolved in one pass.

An implementation of the XML schema must be able to facilitate the reading and/or writing of all characteristics defined within the requirements stated in the Mode function of this standard. Some tools may have only read capability; some may have only write capability. Some tools may have both read/write capability. All schema defined in the standard as mandatory (1-1, 1-n occurrences) shall be executed as appropriate. Tool providers shall identify their capability by Mode (e.g. FULL, FABRICATION, ASSEMBLY etc.).

Each element has a specific function or task. Accordingly, the information interchange for a specific purpose is possible only if that element is populated. The ability to select those characteristics that are appropriate for a given task makes the schema a robust methodology for defining only those areas and characteristics that are necessary to produce a given product. Figure 1 shows the potential children elements of the Top Element (IPC-2581).

## IPC-2581 Children Element

| Attribute / Element Name | Attribute / Element Type | Description | Occurrence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| IPC-2581 | IPC-2581Type | The generic name of the file used to describe Design, Fabrication, Assembly, and Test information in accordance with the IPC-2581 standard. | 1-1 |
| revision | string | The status of the IPC-2581 file content. | 1-1 |
| Content | ContentType | The Content element defines the function of the file, and references the major sections of the product description (i.e., Step, Layer, Bom and Avl). In addition, there are six dictionaries indicated in Content that would contain the pre-described information needed for the file details. | 1-1 |
| LogisticHeader | LogisticHeaderType | The LogisticHeader describes information pertaining to ordering and delivery, by identifying individuals and locations responsible for these functions. | 1-1 |
| HistoryRecord | HistoryRecordType | The HistoryRecord element provides a sequential change number for the IPC-2581 file. The number is changed every time the controlled version of the IPC-2581 file is modified. Also identified are the change approval conditions. | 1-1 |
| Bom | BomType | The Bill of Materials for the board is a list of all the different components to be used for the assembly of the board, arranged by their OEM Design Number (ODN) and the materials used to fabricate the printed board. | 0-n |
| Ecad | EcadType | The Ecad section describes the Computer Aided Design data of the job, including all the graphical description of the layers, component location, panel design, etc. | 1-1 |
| Avl | AvlType | The AVL element contains the list of matching manufacturer’s part numbers (MPNs) and vendor information of a certain component parts. Approved vendors of printed board materials may also be included. | 0-1 |
